# pudgy-rods-sales-bot

A simple Twitter bot that Subscribes to the Pudgy Rods contract's Transfer event. If an OpenSea or LooksRare sale is detected, a tweet is sent out from a Twitter account dedicated to tracking Pudgy Rod sales. Marketplace aggregators (like gem and genie) as well as ENS support coming soon.

Code forked from: https://github.com/tylerpashigian/pudgy-penguins-sales-bot
